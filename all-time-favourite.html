        The story revolves around the main character 'Booker DeWitt' and a girl called Elizabeth. It all starts when Booker is taken to the paradise-land of Colombia, above the clouds.
        There he meets Elizabeth and explosions and schtuff and guns and magic and crows and schtuff and the story begins.</p>

    The Gameplay
    </div>
    
    <div class="para">
       <p> It's got different guns (not very many, the sniper is cool) and plays like a normal FPS game....almost but
        THERE'S MAGIC!
        Except they are called vigours...but yeah magic. You collect and drink several bottles throughout the game that gives you different powers that you execute, like dishonored but the powers aren't quite THAT exciting.</p>

    <div class="para">
        The story.
        It hits you real hard. 
        It's the best story a video game's ever had, IT SHOULD BE MADE INTO A MOVIE!
        but that'll probably ruin it...certainly ruin it. THEY NEVER DO VIDEO GAME MOVIES RIGHT.
